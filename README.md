# **TLC - The Last Chance**
### My second chance to get to know GameDev better - new game **TLC**.
At the design stages, it was supposed to make a game of the _"Tower Defense"_ genre, in fact, without understanding the features of the genre. To be honest, I assumed that the genre of such games involves tower protection, but I did not know that in the main game such a theme is implemented with a top view, build some-find a tower and their improvements (like the game _"Kingdom Rush"_/_"Plants vs Zombie"_). Therefore, the _"Tower Defense"_ field turned out to be the _"Platformer"_ field ~~(without a platform)~~<br><br>
However, unlike the first attempt, I use **C#** + **OOP** here. And honestly, it was more convenient for me to design in **C#** with an already built-in _constructor_ in which you can automatically structure, arrange and align some buttons or triggers, and using Visual Studio the process turned into some kind of LEGO.<BR><BR>
Not to say that it was easy - not at all, but I liked designing games in **C++** more. Although **C#** has its advantages in the same garbage collector, but still something was wrong.<br><br>
The implementation will be shown next:<br><br>
